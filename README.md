This repository contains stacked cross-correlation function data associated with the paper Aiman et al. (2025). The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific profile measurement (e.g., 'N2600' represents a profile along 26 degrees latitude). Within each folder, data is stored in HDF5 format, with individual files containing regionally stacked cross-correlation functions for each grid point.
